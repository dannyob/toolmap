# toolmap

A database for locating physical items, with built in SVG maps to find them.

I have no memory for the physical world, and the physical world has no mercy
for my forgetfulness. To help me dig myself out of this, I built a simple
sqlite database of my possessions, and the piles that I put them in. To help
remember where those piles are, I've drawn some crude SVG pictures (crude in the
sense of badly-drawn, not rude crude) of places those piles get dumped.

This way, when I search for something in this database, it tells me not only
where that thing should be, but also how to find it.
